intro: |+
  The (Generally) Non-Fiction Book Club (London Chapter) has been running for about twenty years, though its precise origins are disputed.

  I've tried to list here all the books we've read, along with the year in which we read them, though I haven't tried to give dates before 2010.

  I've certainly missed some books, probably even some quite recent ones. So help with that would be appreciated.

  I've also provided ratings and comments. The ratings are my opinion only and normally aren't intended to represent a group view, though I've given a warning if a rating is controversial. But such is the nature of book club, I expect that which ratings are controversial and which are not will itself be hotly disputed.

  It is interesting which books I remembered and which I didn't. Some from even the earliest years are still quite vivid. Others, even some from not long ago, are blanks. I've tried to be straight about what I can remember and what I can't, but memory, mine anyway, sometimes plays strange games.
books:
  - title: "Humankind: A Hopeful History"
    author: "Rutger Bregman"
    remarks:
      - Easy to read, well-written and translated.
      - Successfully refutes familiar arguments for thinking humans are basically rotten. For instance he lays out the now well-known flaws in the Stanford Prison Experiments and similar bad science, and relates a real-life Lord of Flies which turned-out much happier than the novel.
      - Also has positive arguments for our basic decency and kindness. Some more persuasive than others.
      - I probably liked this more than anyone in the group, others thought it derivative and a bit lightweight. But I'm prone to cheap cynicism based on half remembered stories, and this book is a great antidote to that.

    known_year: "2003"
    remarks:
      - Still remember Dummett's main argument that from a thoroughgoing liberal perspective there are no good reason to stop people moving to the countries they want to. There might be  some negatives to immigration, but none outweigh the need to respect people's wishes to immigrate and the benefits this brings to the migrants and the host country.
      - I was worried at the time that high immigration can override the wishes of significant numbers of people in the host country. They might be wrong in some sense to have the attitude they have, but how does a democracy deal with the fact that they have that attitude? Seems to me the whole Brexit fiasco has only sharpened this issue.

      - "He's a hard atheist but with the interesting twist that he believes religious experience is real and should be cultivated, but through techniques such as meditation and not  through religious belief."
      - "Not everyone in the group liked this book, I think they found his style insensitive, combative, and, over-literal. I think they are also not very interested in the question of whether religious beliefs are true or false, or in persuading people who hold them to think otherwise. Similar problems with Dawkins."

    author: Philippe Sands
    remarks:
      - A personal investigation of Sands' Jewish roots in eastern Europe evolves into
        a broader history of the development of international law and the people involved
        in shaping the legal concepts used in the Nurembgerg trials.
      - Complex stories and legal debates deftly woven together into a coherent whole.
      - Not always easy to follow, you need a pretty good idea of the history of the period.

    author: Mike Savage
    remarks:
      - Based on the BBC's Great British Class Survey
      - A summary of their satistical clustering analysis.
      - Unpolished, uninsightful and for me very boring.
      - I was disappointed, but perhaps I was looking for more than was ever intended.

    remarks:

      - Missed the MMT option, everything dependend on tax, maybe that's politically necessary
        but meant a big intellectual gap.
      - Rather a dry read.

      - Very divisive book - others in book club thought it sexist and dishonest.

      - "But my abiding memory of this book is a deep irritation; I'm sure my therapist would have something to say about that."
