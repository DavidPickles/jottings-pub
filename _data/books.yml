  title: The (Generally) Non-Fiction Book Club
  description: The List of Books
  ---

intro: |+
  Ratings and comments are mine - I've given a warning if a rating is controversial, but such is the nature of book club, I expect that which ratings are controversial and which are not will itself be disputed.

  Not all books have ratings and comments - I'm working on that. Also I've probably missed some books. Help on both things gratefully received.

  It is interesting which books I remembered and which I didn't. Some from even the earliest years are still quite vivid. Others, even some from not long ago, are blanks. I've tried to be straight about what I can remember and what I can't, but memory, mine anyway, sometimes plays strange games.
