intro: |+
  The (Generally) Non-Fiction Book Club (London Chapter) has been running for about twenty years, though its precise origins are disputed.

  I've tried to list here all the books we've read, along with the year in which we read them, though I haven't tried to give dates before 2010.

  I've certainly missed some books, probably even some quite recent ones. So help with that would be appreciated.

  I've also provided ratings and comments. The ratings are my opinion only and normally aren't intended to represent a group view, though I've given a warning if a rating is controversial. But such is the nature of book club, I expect that which ratings are controversial and which are not will itself be hotly disputed.

  It is interesting which books I remembered and which I didn't. Some from even the earliest years are still quite vivid. Others, even some from not long ago, are blanks. I've tried to be straight about what I can remember and what I can't, but memory, mine anyway, sometimes plays strange games.

    author: Michael Dummett
    meeting_date: "Before 2010"
    known_year: "2003"
    remarks:
      - Still remember Dummett's main argument that from a thoroughgoing liberal perspective there are no good reason to stop people moving to the countries they want to. There might be  some negatives to immigration, but none outweigh the need to respect people's wishes to immigrate and the benefits this brings to the migrants and the host country.
      - I was worried at the time that high immigration can override the wishes of significant numbers of people in the host country. They might be wrong in some sense to have the attitude they have, but how does a democracy deal with the fact that they have that attitude? Seems to me the whole Brexit fiasco has only sharpened this issue.

      - "The politics and potential negative social impacts of this kind of work, and concerns about the intentions of its authors, tend to overwhelm questions about its scientific soundness or logical implications (for instance: Do asians really have higher IQs than whites on average? Does that mean they are intrinsically smarter in some sense? Does this mean we should treat whites differently from asians?)"

      - "Not everyone in the group liked this book, I think they found his style insensitive, combative, and, over-literal. I think they are also not very interested in the question of whether religious beliefs are true or false, or in persuading people who hold them to think otherwise. Similar problems with Dawkins."

        a broader history of the development of international law and the people involved
        in shaping the legal concepts used in the Nurembgerg trials.
      - Complex stories and legal debates deftly woven together into a coherent whole.
      - Not always easy to follow, you need a pretty good idea of the history of the period.

    remarks:
      - Based on the BBC's Great British Class Survey
      - A summary of their satistical clustering analysis.
      - Unpolished, uninsightful and for me very boring.
      - I was disappointed, but perhaps I was looking for more than was ever intended.

    remarks:
      - What it feels like to be aware of opportunity cost - not nice.

        but meant a big intellectual gap.
      - Rather a dry read.

      - Very divisive book - others in book club thought it sexist and dishonest.
