# The (Generally) Non-Fiction Book Club Book List

## Intro

The (Generally) Non-Fiction Book Club has been running since time immemorial, its origins a matter of debate. 

I've tried to list of the books we've read. The ratings and comments are mine - I've tried to give a warning if the rating: is controversial, but such is the nature of book club, I expect that which ratings are controversial and which are not will itself be disputed. 

Not all books have ratings and comments - I'm working on that. Also I've probably missed some books. Help on both things gratefully received.

It was interesting which books I remembered and which I didn't. Some from even the earliest years are still quite vivid. Others, even some from not long ago, are blanks. I've tried to be honest about what I can remember and what I can't. 

#### <NO AUTHOR> *Food Wars: Food Wars: The Global Battle for Mouths, Minds and Markets*

`2017 `Rating: 8

`<NO MEETING DATE> `Rating: 6
- Enjoyable exploration of the nasty side of the interweb-thingy.
- Perhaps a bit outdated by now.

#### Laura Bates *Men Who Hate Women: From incels to pickup artists, the truth about extreme misogyny and how it affects us all*
`2021 `Rating: 8

- It was a long tie ago we read this, and I think it even preceded Corbyn.

#### Simon Baron Cohen *The Essential Difference: Men, Women and the Extreme Male Brain*
`<NO MEETING DATE> `Rating: 7
- Men's brains are statistically more likley to be autistic, and on a wide spectrum men's brains tend to be further along it. Something like that.

#### Nik Cohn *Yes We Have No: Adventures in Other England*
`<NO MEETING DATE> `

#### Michael Collins *The Likes of Us: An Official Biography of the White Working Class*
`<NO MEETING DATE> `Rating: 8
- Reading this was the first time I'd come across the argument that the white working class is being systemically discriminated against.
- Important given the Brexit and the general rise of nationalist populism, driven, to a great extent by the demographic that Collins was describing.

`<NO MEETING DATE> `Rating: 5 ⚠
- Left no impression!

#### Theodore Dalrymple *Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass*
`<NO MEETING DATE> `Rating: 8

- He's a reactionary of sorts, but thoughful and compassionate.

#### Richard Dawkins *The God Delusion*
`<NO MEETING DATE> `

#### Daniel Dennett *Freedom Evolves*
`<NO MEETING DATE> `Rating: 7 ⚠
- Like much of the philosophy, half the book group couldn't see the point.

`<NO MEETING DATE> `

`2018 `Rating: 6

`<NO MEETING DATE> `

#### Cordelia Fine *Delusions of Gender: The Real Science Behind Sex Differences*
`2016 `Rating: 8 ⚠
- I had to miss this book club meeting and didn't finish the book.

#### Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler *Connected: The Amazing Power of Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives*
`<NO MEETING DATE> `
- Looks like quite interesting ideas about the the importance of networks in human relations, but not quite interesting enough for anything to stay with me.

#### Victor E Frankl *Man's Search for Meaning*
`2019 `Rating: 5
- Harrowing and insightful account of experience camps.
- But a patchy as an explanation or intellectual foundation of existential psychotherapy.

#### Frank Furedi *Where have all the intellectuals gone?*

#### Atul Gawande *Being Mortal: Illness, Medicine and What Matters in the End*

#### David Graeber *Bullshit Jobs: The Rise of Pointless Work, and What We Can Do About It*
`2018 `Rating: 8 ⚠
- Fun read bursting with subsersive ideas
- Made sense of much of my frustration with corporate life.
- Some in the group thought it had big intellectual gaps, e.g. is it really waste when it is essential to try several ideas, many of which you know won't work?

#### David Graeber *Debt: The First 5000 Years*
`<NO MEETING DATE> `Rating: 9 ⚠
- Extraordinary book, full of fascinating ideas of vital importance. Rich in anthropological stories and analyses, and a revisionist history of the world from the perspective of the concept of debt.
- Long shaggy and rambling, but brilliant.

`<NO MEETING DATE> `

#### Tom Holland *Domininion*

#### Michel Houellebecq *Atomised*
`<NO MEETING DATE> `

#### Yuval Noah Hrari *Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow*
`2017 `Rating: 5
- Not quite as big and important as it thinks.

#### Michael Lewis *Boomerang: The Metdown Tour*
`2011 `Rating: 7
- Bit of a romp, but very vivid writing and I still remember much of the very funny, and probably very unfair stuff about Iceland.

#### John Lloyd *What the Media are doing to our Politics*
`<NO MEETING DATE> `Rating: 8

`<NO MEETING DATE> `

#### Paul Mason *Post Capitalism: A Guide to Our Future*

#### George Mombiot *Out of the Wreckage: A new politics for an Age of Crisis*
`2017 `Rating: 6
- I enjoyed it at the time, and it seemed important. But apart from that I can remember nothing about it at all, sadly. And things seems to have become significantly worse since it was written.

#### Jan Werner Muller *What is Populism*
`2019 `Rating: 8 ⚠
- I thought it was clear and well argued, nicely explaining a complex thesis and a lot of ancillary ideas about democracy.
- Others didn't like it so much, I think they felt it missed the point somehow.

#### Douglas Murray *The Madness of Crowds: Gender, Race and Identity*
`2020 `Rating: 2
- Expecting controversial, got annoying and half-baked.

`<NO MEETING DATE> `

#### Toby Ord *The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity*
`2020 `Rating: 6

#### Thomas Piketty *Capital in the Twenty-First Century*
`<NO MEETING DATE> `Rating: 7 ⚠
- Huge book with endless historical detail.
- Nearly broke the book club!

#### Steven Pinker *The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature*

#### Carlo Rovelli *Helgoland*
`2021 `Rating: 7 ⚠
- History of quantum mechanics, a new interpreation, and the mind/brain problem solved: all in 200 pages.
- Wildly overambitious but elegantly written.
- The explanations were well written but maybe not as clear as they could have been, for some people that made the book infuriating.

`<NO MEETING DATE> `Rating: 6 ⚠
- Not much trace of this in my mind, other than a vaguely positive blur.

#### Angela Saini *Superior: The return of race science*
`2019 `Rating: 6
- Good read, well written
- Unfortunately the only bit I can remember is the argument from a prominent geneticist that perhaps there is something in race after all: many ways of thinking about it have been thoroughly debunked, but not all.
- Also I think she missed the argument that IQ tests really don't measure anything of objective scienctific value.

#### Michael Sandel *The Tyranny of Merit: Why the Promise of Moving Up Is Pulling America Apart*
`2020 `Rating: 7
- Good read, arguably an important diagnosis of the current US malaise.

`2012 `Rating: 8
- Thought provoking arguments that not all values can be given positions on a monetary scale.

#### Philippe Sands *East West Street: on the origins of genocide and crimes against humanity*
`2021 `Rating: 8
- A personal investigation of Sands' Jewish roots in eastern Europe evolves into a broader history of the development of international law and the people involved in shaping the legal concepts used in the Nurembgerg trials.
- Complex stories and legal debates deftly woven together into a coherent whole.
- Not always easy to follow, you need a pretty good idea of the history of the period.

#### Mike Savage *Social Class in the 21st Century*
`2016 `Rating: 2 ⚠
- Based on the BBC's Great British Class Survey
- A summary of their satistical clustering analysis.

- I was disappointed, but perhaps I was looking for more than was ever intended.

#### Barry Schwartz *The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less*
`<NO MEETING DATE> `Rating: 7
- What it feels like to be aware of opportunity cost - not nice.
- Simple but convincing, not clear what the solution is though.

#### Timothy Snyder *On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century*

- Seemed an  urgent book at the time, and I enjoyed reading it, but has left little trace.

#### Guy Standing *Basic Income: And How we can make it happen.*
`2017 `Rating: 6
- Some well-researched, realistic policy ideas for basic income.
- Missed the MMT option, everything dependend on tax, maybe that's politically necessary but meant a big intellectual gap.
- Rather a dry read.

`2017 `Rating: 8
