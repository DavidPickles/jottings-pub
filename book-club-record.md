# The (Generally) Non-Fiction Book Club Book List

## Intro

The (Generally) Non-Fiction Book Club has been running since time immemorial, and its origins debated. 

The ratings and comments are mine - I've tried to give a warning if the rating is controversial, but such is the nature of book club, I expect that which ratings are controversial and which are not will itself be disputed. 

Not all books have ratings and comments - I'm working on that. Also I've probably missed some books. Help on both things gratefully received.

`<NO MEETING DATE>`

`<NO MEETING DATE>`

#### Daniel Dennett *Freedom Evolves*
rating: 7 :warning:
- Like much of the philosophy, half the book group couldn't see the point.

#### David Graeber *Bullshit Jobs: The Rise of Pointless Work, and What We Can Do About It*
rating: 8 :warning:
- Fun read bursting with subsersive ideas
- Made sense of much of my frustration with corporate life.

`<NO MEETING DATE>`

#### David Graeber *Debt: The First 5000 Years*
rating: 9 :warning:
- Extraordinary book, full of fascinating ideas of vital importance. Rich in anthropological stories and analyses, and a revisionist history of the world from the perspective of the concept of debt.

`<NO MEETING DATE>`

#### Michel Houellebecq *Atomised*
`<NO MEETING DATE>`

#### Yuval Noah Hrari *Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow*

rating: 7

`<NO MEETING DATE>`

#### George Mombiot *Out of the Wreckage: A new politics for an Age of Crisis*
rating: 6

`<NO MEETING DATE>`

#### Jan Werner Muller *What is Populism*
rating: 8 :warning:
- I thought it was clear and well argued, nicely explaining a complex thesis and a lot of ancillary ideas about democracy.
- Others didn't like it so much, I think they felt it missed the point somehow.
`<NO MEETING DATE>`

#### Douglas Murray *The Madness of Crowds: Gender, Race and Identity*
rating: 2

`<NO MEETING DATE>`

#### Toby Ord *The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity*

rating: 8
- Great writing, full of anger, and vivid images.
`<NO MEETING DATE>`

#### Thomas Piketty *Capital in the Twenty-First Century*

`<NO MEETING DATE>`

#### Steven Pinker *The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature*

rating: 6 :warning:
- Not much trace of this in my mind, other than a vaguely positive blur.
`<NO MEETING DATE>`

#### Angela Saini *Superior: The return of race science*
rating: 6
- Good read, well written
- Unfortunately the only bit I can remember is the argument from a prominent geneticist that perhaps there is something in race after all: many ways of thinking about it have been thoroughly debunked, but not all.
- Also I think she missed the argument that IQ tests really don't measure anything of objective scienctific value.
`<NO MEETING DATE>`

#### Michael Sandel *The Tyranny of Merit: Why the Promise of Moving Up Is Pulling America Apart*
rating: 7
- Good read, arguably an important diagnosis of the current US malaise.

rating: 8
- Thought provoking arguments that not all values can be given positions on a monetary scale.
`<NO MEETING DATE>`

rating: 8
- A personal investigation of Sands' Jewish roots in eastern Europe evolves into a broader history of the development of international law and the people involved in shaping the legal concepts used in the Nurembgerg trials.
- Complex stories and legal debates deftly woven together into a coherent whole.
- Not always easy to follow, you need a pretty good idea of the history of the period.
`<NO MEETING DATE>`

#### Mike Savage *Social Class in the 21st Century*
rating: 2 :warning:
- Based on the BBC's Great British Class Survey
- A summary of their satistical clustering analysis.

- I was disappointed, but perhaps I was looking for more than was ever intended.
`<NO MEETING DATE>`

#### Barry Schwartz *The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less*
rating: 7
- What it feels like to be aware of opportunity cost - not nice.

#### Guy Standing *Basic Income: And How we can make it happen.*
rating: 6
- Some well-researched, realistic policy ideas for basic income.
- Missed the MMT option, everything dependend on tax, maybe that's politically necessary but meant a big intellectual gap.
