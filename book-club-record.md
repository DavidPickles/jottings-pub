# The (Generally) Non-Fiction Book Club Book List

## Intro

The (Generally) Non-Fiction Book Club has been running since time immemorial, and its origins debated. 

The ratings and comments are mine - I've tried to give a warning if the rating is controversial, but such is the nature of book club, I expect that which ratings are controversial and which are not will itself be disputed. 

Not all books have ratings and comments - I'm working on that. Also I've probably missed some books. Help on both things gratefully received.

#### Claire Ainsley *The New Working Class: How to Win Hearts, Minds and Votes*
- Well intentioned, well researched policy recommendations
- Earnest and a bit dull

#### Fay Bound Alberti *The Biography of Loneliness: The History of an Emotion*
- Good topic but tenatively argued. I found it hard to pin down what she was saying.

#### Louis Althusser *The Future Lasts a Long Time*

#### Various Authors *Papers and artices on trans issues*
- Included Kathleen Stock (concerned by some aspects of trans activism)
- Provacative and interesting.
- We should do more sets of papers and articles, but it's a bit onerous having to put them together.

#### Jamie Bartlett *The Dark Net*
- Enjoyable exploration of the nasty side of the interweb-thingy.
- Perhaps a bit outdated by now.

#### Laura Bates *Men Who Hate Women: From incels to pickup artists, the truth about extreme misogyny and how it affects us all*
- Well researched and convincing case that there's a growing problem.
- Introductory chapter seemed hasitly written, but the rest of the book a good though depressing read.

#### Jean Baudrillard *The Spirit of Teorrism*
- Can't pretend much as stayed with me apart from a fairly positive buzz.

#### Ulrich Beck *Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity*

#### Sarah-Jayne Blakemore *Inventing ourselves: The Secret Life of the Teenage Brain. *
- Recent research on teenage development.
- Unfortunately geriatic decay means I can't remember much.

#### Mark Blyth *Austerity: The History of Dangerous Idea*
- Convincing arguments that austerity is economically damaging.

#### Paul Boghassian *Fear of Knowledge: Against Relativism and Constructivism*

#### Jonn Carey *What Good are the Arts?*
- Can't remember much about this except he seemed to be arguing unconvingly that they aren't much good for anything.

#### Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivet Carnac *The Future We Choose: A Stubborn Optimistâ€™s Guide to the Climate Crisis*
- Intended to be positive and inspiring about what you can do about climate change.
- Instead illuminating but a bit depressing.

#### Noam Chomsky *A New Generation Draws the Line: Kosovo, East Timor and the Standards of the West*
- I'm embarassed to admit it in certain circles, but Chomsky's political writing rarely engage me.

#### Nick Cohen *What's Left?: How the Left Lost its Way*
- It was a long tie ago we read this, and I think it even preceded Corbyn.

#### Simon Baron Cohen *The Essential Difference: Men, Women and the Extreme Male Brain*
- Men's brains are statistically more likley to be autistic, and on a wide spectrum men's brains tend to be further along it. Something like that.
- Yeah can't remember all the details of his thesis, but interesting stuff about the nature of certain types of autism, and possible differences between yer average man and woman's neural biology.

#### Nik Cohn *Yes We Have No: Adventures in Other England*

#### Michael Collins *The Likes of Us: An Official Biography of the White Working Class*
- Reading this was the first time I'd come across the argument that the white working class is being systemically discriminated against.
- Important given the Brexit and the general rise of nationalist populism, driven, to a great extent by the demographic that Collins was describing.

#### Rosalind Coward *Sacred Cows: Is Feminism Relevant to the New Millennium?*
- Left no impression!

#### Theodore Dalrymple *Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass*
- I've got a soft spot for Theodore Dalrymple, he's worked with the people he describes, and cares about them.
- He's a reactionary of sorts, but thoughful and compassionate.

#### Richard Dawkins *The God Delusion*

#### Daniel Dennett *Freedom Evolves*
- Like much of the philosophy, half the book group couldn't see the point.
- Elegantly written of course (it's Dennett), and I've given it 7 if only for the global coin-tossing competition image, which I love.

#### Meghnad Desai *Marx's Revenge: The Resurgence of Capitalism and the Death of Statist Socialism*

#### Jared Diamond *Guns Germs and Steel: Guns, Germs and Steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years*

#### Danny Dorling *All That is Solid: How the Great Housing Disaster Defines Our Times, and What We Can Do About It*
- Important topic.
- Mixed reception in the group, some thought it lacked sufficient economic sophistication.

#### Reni Eddo-Lodge *Why I'm Longer Talking to White People About Race*
- Descriptions of the problems of being black in the UK
- Well written and angry.
- Felt I wasn't the audience she was addressing, and if she doesn't want to talk to me,  why should I care?

#### Michael Edwards *Civil Society*

#### Cordelia Fine *Delusions of Gender: The Real Science Behind Sex Differences*
- I had to miss this book club meeting and didn't finish the book.
- But it was extremely popular, so that why I've given it high rating with a warning.

#### Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler *Connected: The Amazing Power of Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives*
- Quite interesting ideas about the the importance of networks in human relations.

#### Victor E Frankl *Man's Search for Meaning*
- Harrowing and insightful account of experience camps.
- But a patchy as an explanation or intellectual foundation of existential psychotherapy.

#### Frank Furedi *Where have all the intellectuals gone?*
- Christ! Almost no memory of this except it seemed a fairly pointless provocation.

#### Atul Gawande *Being Mortal: Illness, Medicine and What Matters in the End*
- Humane and graceful description of how to approach death.

#### Anthony Giddens *The Third Way and its Critics: Sequel to "The Third Way"*
- All trace of this melted from my brain a long time ago.

#### Malcom Gladwell *Outliers: The Story of Success*

#### Ben Goldacre *Bad Pharma: How Medicine is Broken, And How We Can Fix It*
- A necessary book cataloging the misdeeds of big pharma.

#### David Graeber *Bullshit Jobs: The Rise of Pointless Work, and What We Can Do About It*
- Fun read bursting with subsersive ideas
- Made sense of much of my frustration with corporate life.
- Some in the group thought it had big intellectual gaps, e.g. is it really waste when it is essential to try several ideas, many of which you know won't work?

#### David Graeber *Debt: The First 5000 Years*
- Extraordinary book, full of fascinating ideas of vital importance. Rich in anthropological stories and analyses, and a revisionist history of the world from the perspective of the concept of debt.
- Long shaggy and rambling, but brilliant.

#### John Gray *Straw Dogs*

#### Ian Hacking *The Social Construction of What?*
- Promised a lot but didn't feel like it delivered the analysis that is needed.

#### Jonathan Haidt *The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion*
- Important and convincing account of different moral frameworks that people bring to their lives. And why we should respect those differences.

#### Sam Harris *The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason*

#### Tom Holland *Domininion*
- One of the most controversial books in terms of interest and enjoyment.
- I liked it a lot. Punchy, well written, a strong though very debatable central thesis, well organised and an incredible range of reference.
- Others found it wrong-headed, annoying, bordering on offensive.

#### Michel Houellebecq *Atomised*

#### Yuval Noah Hrari *Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow*
- Not quite as big and important as it thinks.
- The most interesting ideas are, I think, from his previous book 'Sapiens'. Which one day I'll read.

#### Owen Jones *The Establishment: And How They Get Away With It*
- Smoothly written, well-informed, and persuasive.

#### Tobias Jones *Utopian Dreams*

#### Ben Judah *This is London:  Life and Death in the World City*
- Down and out with romanians in London,
- and insights into some of the darker sides of European immigration into London.
- Came out before the Brexit vote, and reveals some of changes in London that might have encouraged it.

#### Daniel Kahneman *Thinking Fast and Slow*

#### Stephenie Kelton *The Deficit Myth: Modern Monetary Theory and How to Build a Better Economy*
- Clear and convincing argument for Modern Monetary Theory
- A great book for explaining the main ideas of MMT and why they are of vital importance.

#### Mariam Khan *It's Not About the Burqa: Muslim Women on Faith, Feminism, Sexuality and Race*
- Essays by Muslim women about being Muslim in the U.K. today.
- Every essay was illuminating in its own way, from a diverse range of perspectives.

#### Richard Layard *Happiness: Lessons from a New Science*

#### Bernard Lewis *The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror*
- Only the vaguest memory of this - I think it seemed a convincing historial account.

#### John Lloyd *What the Media are doing to our Politics*
- Enraging and prophetic.
- Written well before the current multiple populist shitshows, but describes how media stopped challenging coroporate and political PR machines.

#### Steven Lukes *Liberals & Cannibals: The Implications of Diversity*

#### Paul Mason *Post Capitalism: A Guide to Our Future*
- Urgent and passionate.
- Well explained leftist ideas in economics.

#### David Michaels *The Triumph of Doubt: Dark Money and the Science of Deception*
- Glad this book exists, it makes a solid case that there are serious problems with regulation in the US and globally.
- A bit dull.

#### Ralph Miliband *The State in Capitalist Society*
- How come I can't remember anything about this apart from the fact it was well written and I enjoyed it a time?

#### George Mombiot *Out of the Wreckage: A new politics for an Age of Crisis*
- I enjoyed it at the time, and it seemed important. But apart from that I can remember nothing about it at all, sadly. And things seems to have become significantly worse since it was written.

#### Jan Werner Muller *What is Populism*
- I thought it was clear and well argued, nicely explaining a complex thesis and a lot of ancillary ideas about democracy.
- Others didn't like it so much, I think they felt it missed the point somehow.

#### Douglas Murray *The Madness of Crowds: Gender, Race and Identity*
- Expecting controversial, got annoying and half-baked.

#### Onara O'Neill *A Quesiton of Trust: The Reith Lectures 2002*

#### Toby Ord *The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity*
- Deep well written sustained analysis, but my interest was limited because of restriction to only existential threats which seems to omit the ones that should be most pressing.

#### George Orwell *The Road to Wigan Pier*
- Great writing, full of anger, and vivid images.

#### Thomas Piketty *Capital in the Twenty-First Century*
- Huge book with endless historical detail.
- Nearly broke the book club!

#### Steven Pinker *The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature*
- A big book covering a lot of ground.
- Although it's a long time ago we read it, I still remember some of the arguments, particulary the amazing chapter on identical twins.

#### Robert Putnam *Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community*
- Big, convincingly argued,empirically grounded sociological analysis of the the collapse of social capital in the US.

#### Carlo Rovelli *Helgoland*
- History of quantum mechanics, a new interpreation, and the mind/brain problem solved: all in 200 pages.
- Wildly overambitious but elegantly written.
- The explanations were well written but maybe not as clear as they could have been, for some people that made the book infuriating.

#### Malise Ruthven *Fundamentalism: The Search For Meaning*
- Not much trace of this in my mind, other than a vaguely positive blur.

#### Angela Saini *Superior: The return of race science*
- Good read, well written
- Unfortunately the only bit I can remember is the argument from a prominent geneticist that perhaps there is something in race after all: many ways of thinking about it have been thoroughly debunked, but not all.
- Also I think she missed the argument that IQ tests really don't measure anything of objective scienctific value.

#### Michael Sandel *The Tyranny of Merit: Why the Promise of Moving Up Is Pulling America Apart*
- Good read, arguably an important diagnosis of the current US malaise.
- Caused debate, a lot around how to interpret the main arguments, so although his style seems very clear, evidently the substance isn't as clear as you might think.

#### Michael Sandel *What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets*
- Thought provoking arguments that not all values can be given positions on a monetary scale.

#### Philippe Sands *East West Street: on the origins of genocide and crimes against humanity*
- A personal investigation of Sands' Jewish roots in eastern Europe evolves into a broader history of the development of international law and the people involved in shaping the legal concepts used in the Nurembgerg trials.
- Complex stories and legal debates deftly woven together into a coherent whole.
- Not always easy to follow, you need a pretty good idea of the history of the period.

#### Mike Savage *Social Class in the 21st Century*
- Based on the BBC's Great British Class Survey
- A summary of their satistical clustering analysis.
- Unpolished, uninsightful and for me very boring.
- I was disappointed, but perhaps I was looking for more than was ever intended.

#### Barry Schwartz *The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less*
- What it feels like to be aware of opportunity cost - not nice.
- Simple but convincing, not clear what the solution is though.

#### Roger Scruton *England An Elegy*
- Suprisingly enjoyable.
- Cogent, honest, authorative, beatifully written, and slightly bonkers.

#### Amartya Sen *Development as Freedom*

#### Richard Sennett *The Corrosion of Character: The Personal Consequences of Work in the New Capitalism*

#### Lionel Shriver *We Need to Talk about Kevin*

#### Peter Singer *The Life you can Save: How To Do Your Part To End World Poverty*
- Powerfully written
- A call to action I'm never going to take. So just one of the many reasons I feel vaguely ashamed of myself.

#### Peter Singer *Animal Liberation*
- Powerful case for treating animals better.
- Ok I do eat less meat because of this, but I'm not doing nearly enough.

#### Peter Godfrey Smith *Other Minds: The Octopus, The Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness*
- Beautifully written, engaging and intelligent book.
- Well liked in book club.
- Doesn't go as deeply into the philosophical issues as the title suggests it might, but a good read.

#### Timothy Snyder *On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century*
- Terse didactic warnings on how facism comes about.
- Seemed an  urgent book at the time, and I enjoyed reading it, but has left little trace.

#### Guy Standing *Basic Income: And How we can make it happen.*
- Some well-researched, realistic policy ideas for basic income.
- Missed the MMT option, everything dependend on tax, maybe that's politically necessary but meant a big intellectual gap.
- Rather a dry read.

#### The Secret Barrister *The Secret Barrister: Stories of the Law and How It's Broken*
- Eye-opening descriptions of the shitshow that is the criminal law in the UK.

#### Sherry Turkle *Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other*
- Memorable well-made arguments for why technology might be damaging our relationships.

#### JD Vance *Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis*
- Life and culture in poor white America by someone who worked his way out.
- I liked it very mcuh - vividly written, authentic; seemed to me an insight into a way of life I knew little about.
- Very divisive book - others in book club thought it sexist and dishonest.

#### Yanis Varoufakis *Adults in the Room: My Battle with Europe's Deep Establishment*
- Dramatic, detailed, and engaging account of the Greek crisis, from someone right at the centre of it.
- Popular in the group

#### Adi Schwartz and Einat Wilf *War of Return, The: How Western Indulgence of the Palestinian Dream Has Obstructed the Path to Peace*
- Cogent argument, well written, historically intereting but one sided.

#### Kate Pickett and Richard Wilkinson *The Spirit Level: : Why Equality is Better for Everyone*
- Convincing arguments for how damaning inequality is to societies.
- Prophetic, things have not got better and some of the chickens are coming home to roost.

#### Martin Wolf *Why Globalisation Works*

#### Irwin Yalom *Love's Executioner and other tales of Psychotherapy*
- Beautifully written and engaging
- Everyone in book club liked it.

#### Theodore Zeldin *An Intimate History of Humanity*
- Pretentious twaddle about insufferable people.

#### Slavoj Zizek *Violence: Six sideways reflections*
